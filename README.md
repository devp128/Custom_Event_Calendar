## Challenges and Learning
This project was an opportunity to apply advanced React concepts, implement intricate event scheduling logic, and design an intuitive UI. Key challenges included:
- Ensuring seamless drag-and-drop functionality without breaking the calendar structure.
- Implementing conflict detection for overlapping events.
- Creating a modular and reusable calender component structure with **shadcn**.

Through this project, I enhanced my skills in managing state, optimizing component performance, and designing user-friendly interfaces.
